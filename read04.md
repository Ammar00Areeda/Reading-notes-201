# links in HTML

Hyperlinks
HTML links are hyperlinks.

You can click on a link and jump to another document.

When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand.

## HTML Links - Syntax

The HTML <(a> tag defines a hyperlink. It has the following syntax:

<(a href="url">link text<(/a>

The most important attribute of the <(a> element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination.

The link text is the part that will be visible to the reader.

Clicking on the link text, will send the reader to the specified URL address.

By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:

- An unvisited link is underlined and blue
- A visited link is underlined and purple
- An active link is underlined and red

## The target Attribute

By default, the linked page will be displayed in the current browser window. To change this, you must specify another target for the link.

The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.

The target attribute can have one of the following values:

- self - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked
- blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab
- parent - Opens the document in the parent frame
- top - Opens the document in the full body of the window


# liq

- <(div> elements are often used as containing elements
to group together sections of a page.

- Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you
specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.

- The float property moves content to the left or right
of the page and can be used to create multi-column
layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)

- Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.

- Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide,
and indicate what the site is about within the top 600
pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).

- Grids help create professional and flexible designs.

- CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.

- You can include multiple CSS files in one page.



# WHAT IS A FUNCTION in JS ?

 A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.

 ## Defining functions

 - The name of the function.
- A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
- The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, {...}.

## Function expressions

While the function declaration above is syntactically a statement, functions can also be created by a function expression.

Such a function can be anonymous; it does not have to have a name. For example, the function square could have been defined as:

const square = function(number) { return number * number }
var x = square(4) // x gets the value 16

However, a name can be provided with a function expression. Providing a name allows the function to refer to itself, and also 
makes it easier to identify the function in a debugger's stack traces:

## Calling functions

Defining a function does not execute it. Defining it names the function and specifies what to do when the function is called.

Calling the function actually performs the specified actions with the indicated parameters. For example, if you define the function square, you could call it

square(5);

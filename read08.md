## liquid layout    

The liquid layout uses 
percentages to specify the width 
of each box so that the design 
will stretch to fit the size of the 
screen.
When trying this in your 
browser, remember to make the 
window smaller and larger.

There is a rule on the <(body>
element to set the width of the 
page to 90% so that there is a 
small gap between the left and 
right-hand sides of the browser 
window and the main content.
The three columns are all given 
a margin of 1% and a width of 
31.3%. This adds up to 99.9% 
of the width of the <(body>
element, so some browsers 
might not perfectly align the 
right-hand side of the third 
column with other elements on 
the page. 
The <(div> elements that hold 
the navigation, feature, and 
footer will stretch to fill the 
width of the containing <(body>
element. They are given a 1% 
margin to help them align with 
the columns.
If you imagine the browser 
window to be very wide or very 
narrow, you can see how lines of 
text could become very long or 
very short.
This is where the min-width
and max-width properties help 
create boundaries within which 
the layout can stretch (although 
Internet Explorer 7 was the first 
version of IE to support these 
properties).

## Layout Grids


Composition in any visual art (such as design, painting, or photography) 
is the placement or arrangement of visual elements â€” how they are 
organized on a page. Many designers use a grid structure to help them 
position items on a page, and the same is true for web designers.

On the right, you can see a set of 
thick vertical lines superimposed 
over the top of a newspaper 
website to show you how the 
page was designed according to 
a grid. This grid is called the 960 
pixel grid and is widely used by 
web designers. 

Grids set consistent proportions 
and spaces between items which 
helps to create a professional 
looking design. 
If you flick back through the 
pages of this book you will see 
that it, too, has been constructed 
according to a grid (comprising 
three columns).
As you will see on pages 389-
390, it is possible to create many 
different layouts using this one 
versatile grid

While a grid might seem like a 
restriction, in actual fact it:

- Creates a continuity between 
different pages which may 
use different designs
-  Helps users predict where to 
find information on various 
pages
- Makes it easier to add new 
content to the site in a 
consistent way
- Helps people collaborate 
on the design of a site in a 
consistent way

## Structure
the structure for HTML contains many  main thing

- The <(!DOCTYPE HTML)> declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document

- The <(html)> element is the root element of an HTML page

- The <(head)> element contains meta information about the HTML page

- The <(title)> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)

- The <(body)> element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.

HTML pages are text documents.

- HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled
brackets) to give the information they surround special
meaning.

- Tags are often referred to as elements.
- Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes
the end.

- Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
about the content of that element.
- Attributes require a name and a value.

- To learn HTML you need to know what tags are
available for you to use, what they do, and where they
can go.
